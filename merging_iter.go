// mergingIter provides a merged view of multiple iterators from different
// levels of the LSM.
//
// The core of a mergingIter is a heap of internalIterators (see
// mergingIterHeap). The heap can operate as either a min-heap, used during
// forward iteration (First, SeekGE, Next) or a max-heap, used during reverse
// iteration (Last, SeekLT, Prev). The heap is initialized in calls to First,
// Last, SeekGE, and SeekLT. A call to Next or Prev takes the current top
// element on the heap, advances its iterator, and then "fixes" the heap
// property. When one of the child iterators is exhausted during Next/Prev
// iteration, it is removed from the heap.
//
// Range Deletions
//
// A mergingIter can optionally be configured with a slice of range deletion
// iterators. The range deletion iterator slice must exactly parallel the point
// iterators and the range deletion iterator must correspond to the same level
// in the LSM as the point iterator. Note that each memtable and each table in
// L0 is a different "level" from the mergingIter perspective. So level 0 below
// does not correspond to L0 in the LSM.
//
// A range deletion iterator iterates over fragmented range tombstones. Range
// tombstones are fragmented by splitting them at any overlapping points. This
// fragmentation guarantees that within an sstable tombstones will either be
// distinct or will have identical start and end user keys. While range
// tombstones are fragmented within an sstable, the start and end keys are not truncated
// to sstable boundaries. This is necessary because the tombstone end key is
// exclusive and does not have a sequence number. Consider an sstable
// containing the range tombstone [a,c)#9 and the key "b#8". The tombstone must
// delete "b#8", yet older versions of "b" might spill over to the next
// sstable. So the boundary key for this sstable must be "b#8". Adjusting the
// end key of tombstones to be optionally inclusive or contain a sequence
// number would be possible solutions (such solutions have potentially serious
// issues: tombstones have exclusive end keys since an inclusive deletion end can
// be converted to an exclusive one while the reverse transformation is not possible;
// the semantics of a sequence number for the end key of a range tombstone are murky).
//
// The approach taken here performs an
// implicit truncation of the tombstone to the sstable boundaries.
//
// During initialization of a mergingIter, the range deletion iterators for
// batches, memtables, and L0 tables are populated up front. Note that Batches
// and memtables index unfragmented tombstones.  Batch.newRangeDelIter() and
// memTable.newRangeDelIter() fragment and cache the tombstones on demand. The
// L1-L6 range deletion iterators are populated by levelIter. When configured
// to load range deletion iterators, whenever a levelIter loads a table it
// loads both the point iterator and the range deletion
// iterator. levelIter.rangeDelIter is configured to point to the right entry
// in mergingIter.levels. The effect of this setup is that
// mergingIter.levels[i].rangeDelIter always contains the fragmented range
// tombstone for the current table in level i that the levelIter has open.
//
// Another crucial mechanism of levelIter is that it materializes fake point
// entries for the table boundaries if the boundary is range deletion
// key. Consider a table that contains only a range tombstone [a-e)#10. The
// sstable boundaries for this table will be a#10,15 and
// e#72057594037927935,15. During forward iteration levelIter will return
// e#72057594037927935,15 as a key. During reverse iteration levelIter will
// return a#10,15 as a key. These sentinel keys act as bookends to point
// iteration and allow mergingIter to keep a table and its associated range
// tombstones loaded as long as there are keys at lower levels that are within
// the bounds of the table.
//
// The final piece to the range deletion puzzle is the LSM invariant that for a
// given key K newer versions of K can only exist earlier in the level, or at
// higher levels of the tree. For example, if K#4 exists in L3, k#5 can only
// exist earlier in the L3 or in L0, L1, L2 or a memtable. Get very explicitly
// uses this invariant to find the value for a key by walking the LSM level by
// level. For range deletions, this invariant means that a range deletion at
// level N will necessarily shadow any keys within its bounds in level Y where
// Y > N. One wrinkle to this statement is that it only applies to keys that
// lie within the sstable bounds as well, but we get that guarantee due to the
// way the range deletion iterator and point iterator are bound together by a
// levelIter.
//
// Tying the above all together, we get a picture where each level (index in
// mergingIter.levels) is composed of both point operations (pX) and range
// deletions (rX). The range deletions for level X shadow both the point
// operations and range deletions for level Y where Y > X allowing mergingIter
// to skip processing entries in that shadow. For example, consider the
// scenario:
//
//   r0: a---e
//   r1:    d---h
//   r2:       g---k
//   r3:          j---n
//   r4:             m---q
//
// This is showing 5 levels of range deletions. Consider what happens upon
// SeekGE("b"). We first seek the point iterator for level 0 (the point values
// are not shown above) and we then seek the range deletion iterator. That
// returns the tombstone [a,e). This tombstone tells us that all keys in the
// range [a,e) in lower levels are deleted so we can skip them. So we can
// adjust the seek key to "e", the tombstone end key. For level 1 we seek to
// "e" and find the range tombstone [d,h) and similar logic holds. By the time
// we get to level 4 we're seeking to "n".
//
// One consequence of not truncating tombstone end keys to sstable boundaries
// is the seeking process described above cannot always seek to the tombstone
// end key in the older level. For example, imagine in the above example r3 is
// a partitioned level (i.e., L1+ in our LSM), and the sstable containing [j,
// n) has "k" as its upper boundary. In this situation, compactions involving
// keys at or after "k" can output those keys to r4+, even if they're newer
// than our tombstone [j, n). So instead of seeking to "n" in r4 we can only
// seek to "k".  To achieve this, the instance variable `largestUserKey.`
// maintains the upper bounds of the current sstables in the partitioned
// levels. In this example, `levels[3].largestUserKey` holds "k", telling us to
// limit the seek triggered by a tombstone in r3 to "k".
//
// During actual iteration levels can contain both point operations and range
// deletions. Within a level, when a range deletion contains a point operation
// the sequence numbers must be checked to determine if the point operation is
// newer or older than the range deletion tombstone. The mergingIter maintains
// the invariant that the range deletion iterators for all levels newer that
// the current iteration key (L < m.heap.items[0].index) are positioned at the
// next (or previous during reverse iteration) range deletion tombstone. We
// know those levels don't contain a range deletion tombstone that covers the
// current key because if they did the current key would be deleted. The range
// deletion iterator for the current key's level is positioned at a range
// tombstone covering or past the current key. The position of all of other
// range deletion iterators is unspecified. Whenever a key from those levels
// becomes the current key, their range deletion iterators need to be
// positioned. This lazy positioning avoids seeking the range deletion
// iterators for keys that are never considered. (A similar bit of lazy
// evaluation can be done for the point iterators, but is still TBD).
//
// For a full example, consider the following setup:
//
//   p0:               o
//   r0:             m---q
//
//   p1:              n p
//   r1:       g---k
//
//   p2:  b d    i
//   r2: a---e           q----v
//
//   p3:     e
//   r3:
//
// If we start iterating from the beginning, the first key we encounter is "b"
// in p2. When the mergingIter is pointing at a valid entry, the range deletion
// iterators for all of the levels < m.heap.items[0].index are positioned at
// the next range tombstone past the current key. So r0 will point at [m,q) and
// r1 at [g,k). When the key "b" is encountered, we check to see if the current
// tombstone for r0 or r1 contains it, and whether the tombstone for r2, [a,e),
// contains and is newer than "b".
//
// Advancing the iterator finds the next key at "d". This is in the same level
// as the previous key "b" so we don't have to reposition any of the range
// deletion iterators, but merely check whether "d" is now contained by any of
// the range tombstones at higher levels or has stepped past the range
// tombstone in its own level or higher levels. In this case, there is nothing to be done.
//
// Advancing the iterator again finds "e". Since "e" comes from p3, we have to
// position the r3 range deletion iterator, which is empty. "e" is past the r2
// tombstone of [a,e) so we need to advance the r2 range deletion iterator to
// [q,v).
//
// The next key is "i". Because this key is in p2, a level above "e", we don't
// have to reposition any range deletion iterators and instead see that "i" is
// covered by the range tombstone [g,k). The iterator is immediately advanced
// to "n" which is covered by the range tombstone [m,q) causing the iterator to
// advance to "o" which is visible.
//
// TODO(peter,rangedel): For testing, advance the iterator through various
// scenarios and have each step display the current state (i.e. the current
// heap and range-del iterator positioning).
