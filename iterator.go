// Iterator iterates over a DB's key/value pairs in key order.
//
// An iterator must be closed after use, but it is not necessary to read an
// iterator until exhaustion.
//
// An iterator is not necessarily goroutine-safe, but it is safe to use
// multiple iterators concurrently, with each in a dedicated goroutine.
//
// It is also safe to use an iterator concurrently with modifying its
// underlying DB, if that DB permits modification. However, the resultant
// key/value pairs are not guaranteed to be a consistent snapshot of that DB
// at a particular point in time.
